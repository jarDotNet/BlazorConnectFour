<h1>Connect Four</h1>

<p>
    <b>Connect Four</b> (also known as <b>Four Up</b>, <b>Plot Four</b>, <b>Find Four</b>, <b>Four in a Row</b>, <b>Four in a Line</b>, <b>Drop Four</b>, and <b>Gravitrips</b> (in Soviet Union))
    is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
    The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four
    of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

                    A gameplay example (right), shows the first player starting Connect Four by dropping one of their yellow discs into the center column of an empty game board. The two players
                    then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with red discs, achieves a diagonal four in a row, and wins the game.
                    For games where the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the games are a draw.
